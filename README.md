ML Model Monitoring & Drift Detection

Project Overview
This project focuses on monitoring deployed machine learning models to detect data drift and performance degradation over time. The goal is to identify silent model failures early using statistical drift detection and performance tracking, similar to real-world production ML systems.

Key Focus Areas
- Model performance monitoring over time
- Data drift detection
- Early warning signals for model decay
- Practical, production-oriented ML evaluation# ml-model-monitoring-drift-detection
Detecting data drift and performance decay in deployed ML models.
